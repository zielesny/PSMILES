 * PSmiles Viewer:<br>
 * This application validates and displays an entered PSMILES line notation
 * using the GraphStream dynamic graph library. Additional functionalities include several screenshot
 * options for the graph, settings for the display of the graph (such as node color, 
 * node size and node shape) and displaying some exemplary PSMILES structures 
 * from a given file. The GUI components were created using the java Swing library.

PSMILES â€“ A particle-based Molecular Structure Representation for Mesoscopic Simulation

PSMILES is a particle-based molecular structure representation which is similar to the atom-based SMILES line notation. It aims at supporting particle-based mesoscopic simulation techniques like Dissipative Particle Dynamics.
An open Java library for PSMILES structure handling and mesoscopic simulation support in combination with an open Java Graphical User Interface viewer application for visual topological inspection of PSMILES molecule definitions are provided.

PSMILES uses the [GraphStream](http://graphstream-project.org/) and [Apache Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/) libraries and is published as open source under the GNU General Public License version 3. PSmiles.jar is a Java library for PSMILES handling and mesoscopic simulation support. PSmilesToGraphStream.jar is a connection library used by PSmilesViewer.jar, a Java Graphical User Interface (GUI) viewer application for visual topological inspection and manipulation of PSMILES molecule definitions. This repository contains the Java bytecode libraries, a Windows OS installer for the PSmilesViewer GUI application, all Javadoc HTML documentations and the Netbeans source code packages including Unit tests.

PSMILES is currently under scientific review - additional information will be published soon.
